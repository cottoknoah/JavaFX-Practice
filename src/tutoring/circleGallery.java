//        3. In CircleGallery, make sure you have the required imports for building a JavaFX
//        application as well as the imports for a TextField, Label, Button, Hbox, and VBox. You
//        will also need the Insets class to set the padding of a control later in this program.
//        4. In the start method of this program, construct an object of the Circle class.
//        5. Construct a TextField that will be used to accept the user’s input for the diameter of the
//        Circle object. Also, construct a Label indicating that this TextField is used for the circle’s
//        diameter. Place both of these controls into an HBox.
