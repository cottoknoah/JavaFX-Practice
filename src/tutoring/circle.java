public class circle {
}

//        1. The Circle class has a single field of type double for the diameter of the circle.
//        2. The Circle class consists of three methods: a constructor that takes no arguments and
//        initializes the circleâ€™s diameter to 1.0, a setter that assigns a passed in value (as a String
//        or a double) to the diameter, and a getter that returns the diameter.
